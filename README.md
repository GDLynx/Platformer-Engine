# Platformer-Engine
A platformer engine made by me written using Javascript and canvas. As it is a personal project I likely won't be accepting contributions. 

# TasK-list: 
* Write underlying code - done 
* Clean code 
* Objectify player mechanics (movement, jumping, collisions etcetera) 
* Objectify platform/s
